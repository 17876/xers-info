In September 2019 Anton X participated in the project of the ensemble MaNN AUS OBST GELDWÄSCHE as a performer and improviser.

Programme notes:

At least clean a euro properly. At least a little bit. Five musicians and performers attempt to free themselves from their personal entanglement in global capital flows by washing their own money. They ideally would like to borrow all the money from all the banks, wash it and bring it back. And ideally, they would also build a sewage treatment plant somewhere in virtual space for the large international money flows. - But even the first harmless cent from a child's savings box cannot remove the traces of corruption, war, colonialism, exploitation, arms exports and genocide. Nevertheless, everything is tried: singing so beautifully that every coin simply has to be cleaned from it. Washing cycles in machines of different centuries - including a Miele from 1903. Critical examination of the belief in money. Reflection on one's own financial biography. Bury notes for a while. Shaking coins in a balalaika.

An evening between comedy and despair, absurd theatre and sound installation - for all those who still haven't given up the longing for an even better idea than that of global capitalism.
