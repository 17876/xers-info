DETOX is the collaboration of composer and media artist Anton X and musician and performer Maja vK.

Money laundering is a long-term performance project in which the artists of DETOX reflect on their own and the general entanglement in global capital flows. It takes place once a month in changing formats. 98% desperation, 2% wit.

In the expanded space of contemporary music, sound art, performance and critical thinking, the artists* perform a money laundering on the 11th of each month in changing formats and collaborations – a socio-critical ritual that is 98% based on desperation and 2% on wit.
It is a reflection on one’s own privilege, on money as a medium of alienation, as a medium of domination and injustice -and on art, that is also entangled in this dynamic.
The project is embedded in the attempt to let the common life be determined as little as possible by the logic of anonymity and quantifiability.
This attempt is not to be understood in the sense of a romantic utopia, but as a daily recognition and cultivation of hardly definable multifaceted relations between people*.
