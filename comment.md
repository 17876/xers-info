tryed to manage z-index in order to make the overlay links on the front page on the top of the footer and in the same time make the footer scrollable. a solution would be to switch pointer-events for main content, when the mouse enters and leaves the footer. for that starter the mouse tracking function in index.js. didn't finish. next step would be to translate the coordinates of the footer corners to the document coordinates and to track the mouse.
