I film people
They hand over their time to the frames
They are
	just there
At some point
they will be
	no longer there
Just like
	me
Just like
	the exposed semiconductors
It is
	cold
I try
	not to intervene
It does not work

A moment is not a duration
A frame is a duration
The time beyond the shutter speed is ungraspable
Frames are only fucking outlines
A pixelated past
And the present with its
	infinite
   	and overwhelming
			and cruel need for communication
				escapes the shutter

I love recordings
No matter what kind
They are poetic machines
Sealed time is like a mass
When replayed
	it bends the present
Something changes
	when the sealed time
		is released and becomes the present

This pixelated past
Gives more
	than it actually is
		but not necessarily
			than it takes
