One year of work
The first ideas
	collecting material
		sketches and texts - before the war
Is about home
	school
		socialisation
			history
				propaganda
Horror
	past
		now

Symmetrical structure materially
	not temporally
Documentary footages of Cherepovets from different decades
	60s, 70s, 80s, 90s
Documentary footage of my village Glukhoe
	2021
Documentary footage of the First Chechen War
Documentary footage of the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan
Stalin's shooting lists for Kharkiv
	in the first grade writing primer
My soviet alphabet book
	the sentences from it
 	montaged into Stalin's shooting lists
A video from Kharkiv after the first bombs
	that the guys sent me
		who were at our place in March

Polyphony of times

At the beginning I read out Eugene Onegin at the age of five
	recorded by my father
At the end I read Eugene Onegin at the age of 38
	recorded by myself
At the beginning every five year old syllable granularly frozen
In the course of these 17 minutes the syllables age
Sound ageing echoes flesh ageing

Polyphony of the ages

The syllables speak from the alphabet book
The syllables speak of the Great Terror

Not a 100%-fixed-media thing
At the screening: in the structural middle a live insertion
