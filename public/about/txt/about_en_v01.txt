Today is November 19th 2025 and I'm refusing to write about myself in third person.
I am a composer, field recordist, analog photographer, and (sound) engineer.

I love time and I hate empire. In my work, I seek to develop approaches that oppose the imperial logic of alienation, constant expansion, and unlimited growth. I understand art as a tool for community building — and, consequently, as a tool of political resistance.

I aim to challenge the exhibitive logic of art dictated by the idea of modernity, seeking for ways not to create objects that stand solely for themselves in their uselessness—or, in other words, that find their usefulness only within the framework of the system “art”. This separation from everyday life is deeply rooted in the colonial logic of extracting objects from communities destroyed by imperial rule. Instead, I aim to use so-called artistic tools to create objects that can become part of a community without being embedded in the framework of modern art.
